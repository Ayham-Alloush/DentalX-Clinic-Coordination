# DentalX: Dental Clinic Coordination System

## Project Overview

**DentalX** is a comprehensive web-based application developed as a graduation project at Tishreen University, Faculty of Informatics Engineering, Software and Information Systems Department (Academic Year 2023-2024). It is designed to streamline communication and information exchange between dentists and dental prosthetics laboratories. The system aims to enhance the quality of patient care by providing a secure and efficient environment for managing patient records, appointments, treatments, and billing, while also facilitating material orders and improving operational efficiency for clinics and labs.

## Key Features

DentalX offers a range of functionalities to support both dentists and laboratory technicians:

* **User Management & Authentication:** Supports two account types (Dentist and Laboratory Technician) with secure login and account update capabilities.
* **Laboratory Browse & Filtering:** Dentists can view and sort available laboratories by name, type, or location, along with prices and locations.
* **Order Management:** Dentists can submit detailed material orders, track their status, and laboratories can approve, reject (with reasons), or update order progress (e.g., in preparation, ready for shipping, delivered).
* **Profile & Portfolio Management:** Laboratories can update material prices and manage their work gallery by adding or deleting images.
* **Responsive Design:** The application is built for compatibility and optimal display across various devices and browsers.
* **Data Security:** Implements session-based authentication to ensure secure access and protect user information.

## Technologies Used

This project leverages a combination of robust frontend and backend technologies:

* **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap 5.3, JavaScript (for dynamic interactions and form validation).
* **Backend:** PHP (for server-side logic and database interactions).
* **Database:** MySQL (for relational data storage).
* **Development Tools:** XAMPP (local server environment), .htaccess (web server configuration), JSON (data exchange), Visual Studio Code (code editor), and GitHub (version control and collaboration).

## Future Enhancements (Proposed Developments)

Potential future developments to enhance DentalX include:

* **Dentist Features:** Ability to upload patient impression images with orders, rate laboratories, search/sort labs by rating, and integrate e-payment options.
* **System-wide Updates:** Improved user interface, Dark Mode, "Forgot Password" functionality, direct messaging between users, and map-based location integration.

## Project Status
